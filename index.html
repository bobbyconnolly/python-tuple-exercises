    <h1>Tuple Exercises</h1>

    <div class="important-note">
        <p><span class="highlight">Important Note:</span> In the following three exercises, tuples can be substituted with lists without changing the behavior of the code. However, this is not always true in general Python programming.</p>
        <p>For these examples, you can think of tuples as immutable lists. But remember, there are cases where tuples provide special behavior that lists cannot replicate. Exercise 4 will demonstrate such a case.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="exercise">
        <h2>Exercise 1: Function Return Values and Conditional Statements</h2>
        <p>Create a function called <code>analyze_scores</code> that takes a tuple of three test scores as an argument. The function should return a tuple containing the average score and a string indicating the performance level based on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the average is 90 or above, return "Excellent"</li>
            <li>If the average is between 70 and 89, return "Good"</li>
            <li>If the average is below 70, return "Needs Improvement"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then, write a main program that calls this function with different score tuples and prints the results.</p>
        <pre>
def analyze_scores(scores):
    # Your code here

# Test the function
test_scores = (85, 92, 78)
result = analyze_scores(test_scores)
print(f"Average: {result[0]}, Performance: {result[1]}")
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h2>Exercise 2: Tuple Unpacking in a Loop with Dictionary</h2>
        <p>You are given a list of tuples representing products in a store. Each tuple contains (product_name, price, quantity). Create a program that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Calculates the total value of each product (price * quantity)</li>
            <li>Stores the results in a dictionary with the product name as the key</li>
            <li>Prints out the products with a total value greater than $100</li>
        </ol>
        <pre>
products = [
    ("Laptop", 1000, 3),
    ("Mouse", 25, 10),
    ("Monitor", 200, 2),
    ("Keyboard", 50, 5)
]

inventory_value = {}

# Your code here

# Print products with total value > $100
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h2>Exercise 3: Nested Tuples and Basic Python Constructs</h2>
        <p>You are given a tuple of tuples representing a small database of employees. Each inner tuple contains (name, department, salary). Write a program that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creates a list of all employees in the "Engineering" department</li>
            <li>Calculates and prints the average salary of engineers</li>
            <li>Calculates the average salary for the entire company</li>
            <li>Uses a conditional statement to print whether the Engineering department's average salary is above or below the company's average salary</li>
        </ol>
        <pre>
employees = (
    ("Alice", "Engineering", 80000),
    ("Bob", "Sales", 65000),
    ("Charlie", "Engineering", 90000),
    ("David", "Marketing", 70000),
    ("Eve", "Engineering", 85000)
)

# Step 1: Create a list of engineers
engineers = []
# Your code here

# Step 2: Calculate average salary of engineers
# Your code here

# Step 3: Calculate average salary for the entire company
# Your code here

# Step 4: Compare Engineering average to company average
# Your code here

# Print your results

    <div class="exercise">
        <h2>Exercise 4: Tuples as Dictionary Keys</h2>
        <p>This exercise demonstrates a case where <span class="highlight">tuples cannot be replaced by lists</span>. Create a program that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Uses tuples of (x, y) coordinates as keys in a dictionary to store point data</li>
            <li>Tries to do the same with lists and handles the resulting error</li>
            <li>Explains why this operation works with tuples but not with lists</li>
        </ol>
        <pre>
# Dictionary with tuple keys (this works)
point_data = {
    (0, 0): "Origin",
    (1, 0): "Unit X",
    (0, 1): "Unit Y"
}

# Try to create a dictionary with list keys (this will raise an error)
try:
    invalid_point_data = {
        [0, 0]: "Origin",
        [1, 0]: "Unit X",
        [0, 1]: "Unit Y"
    }
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
